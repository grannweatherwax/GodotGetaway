# Code from the GodotGetaway Course

## Purpose
This repository captures the lecture by lecture code entry for the GodotGetaway course for reference and code reuse.

## How to use this
Commits should reflect lecture-by-lecture change to the overall code through the course of the lectures.

## Limitations
The repository was created after quite a lot of coding was done. The content which is not reflected in individual commits includes: 
* setting up multiplayer functionality
* controlling the vehiclebody and customizing the driving experience
* starting with procedural generation of the city's gridmap for single player and multiplayer

Subsequent commits should reflect finer-grained changes to the code.
